00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Hi there, today let's do some more work on not using boring words, not using the basic

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,000
ordinary English words for things and instead on developing your vocabulary further.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,760
I did a podcast number 498 where I did this same exercise with words for good, so I gave

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,240
you a lot of different synonyms for good which will help your English language learning.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,320
Hello, I'm Hillary and you're listening to Adapt English.

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,040
We will help you to speak English fluently or you have to do is listen, so start listening

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,640
now and find out how it works.

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,320
This podcast will help you sound more like a native English speaker and less like a beginner

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
at speaking English.

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,520
So let's develop your vocabulary, let's make it more vivid, not boring.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,360
And today I'm going to do words for big or large.

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Useful in everyday conversation but also will elevate your level of English for any

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
IELTS or similar English language tests.

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,880
Adapt English provides a lot of free language learning services for people all across

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
the world.

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,480
And in particular our services are helpful to people in countries where they are prevented

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,120
by their government from buying English language learning courses.

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,600
So one of the ways in which you can support Adapt English and help us is simply by becoming

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,680
an Adapt English subscriber.

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,080
This helps us on platforms like YouTube and Spotify.

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
You know how this works.

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,400
The more subscribers we have, the higher up the rankings on YouTube and Spotify we go

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,000

So don't forget, subscribe today on YouTube, on Spotify or wherever else you listen.

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,160
Thank you very much for doing that.

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,680
So today let's continue working on making your vocabulary vivid.

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,440
Let's continue helping you speak English in an interesting way.

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,040
It's one of the things that's really noticeable about beginners in a language.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,520
You've got a restricted range of words and it's very noticeable on adjectives.

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,880
So words we use to describe nouns.

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,680
And given the podcast I gave you last week where I was talking about high frequency words,

35
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,720
there's nothing wrong with this.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,400
But if you want to take your learning stage further and become an intermediate speaker of English

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,720
rather than the beginner, then knowing a greater variety of words, especially adjectives,

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,600
will be really helpful to you.

39
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,040
English always has a number of words for the same thing.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,880
Synonyms if you like.

41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,400
So today here goes for synonyms or words which mean the same.

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,880
Synonyms for big or large.

43
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,280
So big, BIG is a default word.

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,880
It's one you'll already know.

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,480
A mountain is big.

46
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,280
The NHS is big.

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,240
The landmass of Russia is big.

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,880
The other very normal default word for this is large LARGE.

49
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,760
Large and big are pretty much the same.

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,240
If anything large is a little more formal and big is a little more informal.

51
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:08,640
In a newspaper article I think the word LARGE would tend to be used, but you may also find

52
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
big.

53
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,840
So remember that word synonym, S-Y-N-O-N-Y-M.

54
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,120
And it means a different word but with the same meaning.

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,200
Here are some sentences for you which include some synonyms for large or big.

56
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,800
It's a giant tree.

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,920
They own several gigantic houses.

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
The mountain was huge.

59
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,160
There was a humongous gap between the platform and the train.

60
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,720
Her car is enormous and difficult to park.

61
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,200
The building was colossal.

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,680
It is with immense gratitude that I receive this donation.

63
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,680
That was a gargantuan meal that you cooked.

64
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,680
The auditorium was vast and silent.

65
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,800
So let's go through those adjectives.

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,720
That means you can replace one with another and there's not much difference in meaning.

67
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,920
They're not completely interchangeable though.

68
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,640
So the first sentence, it's a giant tree, T-R-E-E.

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,200
The word giant G-I-A-N-T.

70
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,640
It's a noun that's a word for a very, very large being.

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:30,960
You sort you meet in children's stories or perhaps in Tolkien, a magically large person,

72
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,760
like Gulliver from Gulliver's travels perhaps if you know that book.

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,240
So when we use giant as an adjective, we mean similarly large.

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,400
Something that's much bigger than you would expect.

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Giant size, we get this on packaging.

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,160
It's a giant pack of whatever it is you're buying.

77
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,680
Similarly the word gigantic, G-I-G-A-N-T-I-C.

78
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,960
It's a related word and it comes from a similar word stem in Latin as giant.

79
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,840
If you suffer from the medical condition, giganticism, it means you're a giant.

80
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,320
You're abnormally big and large.

81
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,600
If there's a difference in use here, then possibly you're more likely to use giant

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,960
or gigantic about physical items rather than in an abstract way.

83
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,560
But that's not a firm rule.

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,040
Similarly the word gargantuan, G-I-R-G-A-N-T.

85
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,880
You-A-N.

86
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,600
Gargantuan is also related to giants.

87
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
Apparently it comes from a novel by the French writer Raba-Lay.

88
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,200
And one of his heroes is the giant gargantua.

89
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,880
Apparently this giant had an enormous throat to your throat down inside there.

90
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,920
What you used to swallow is, gargantua would eat people.

91
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,920
And this word may come from gargantua.

92
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't know how to pronounce that, but that's a word in Spanish or Portuguese, meaning

93
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
throat.

94
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,080
So presumably gargantua had a big throat.

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,720
So that he could eat people.

96
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,440
Maybe that image will help you remember the word gargantuan.

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,480
Next ones, the mountain was huge.

98
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,200
There was a humongous gap between the train and the platform.

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
So these words are also related.

100
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Huge is H-U-G-E.

101
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,800
That's much more common.

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,600
And probably pronunciation is the biggest challenge with that word, relating its spelling

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,960
with its pronunciation.

104
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,720
If you don't know the word huge, do have a look at how it's spelled H-U-G-E.

105
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,320
Huge and humongous, slightly less common.

106
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,400
So huge mongous, if anything, is probably slightly bigger than huge.

107
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,360
If something is humongous, it probably shocks and it stands you with its size.

108
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,720
Much the spelling on humongous as well.

109
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
H-U-M-O-N-G-O-U-S.

110
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Humongous.

111
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,880
Next, enormous.

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,080
The n-O-R-M-O-U-S.

113
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,200
That is a good old-round word for very large.

114
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,440
And it's probably one of the more common ones.

115
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,840
Elephants are enormous.

116
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,160
It's slightly more usual as well to use enormous to describe abstract things, abstract words.

117
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,640
So words at an ideas level.

118
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,440
There's also a noun to go with enormous.

119
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Inormity.

120
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,320
E-N-O-R-M-I-T-Y.

121
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,320
The enormity of the problem just became clear, for instance.

122
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Colossal.

123
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,320
CO-L-O-S-S-A-L.

124
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,520
That's another one.

125
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,560
And the association of this word is fairly obvious.

126
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,800
If you think about buildings in ancient Rome, you'll think about the Colosseum, for instance.

127
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,960
The one that contained lions sometimes.

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:09,840
And Colossus, CO-L-O-S-S-U-S means an enormous statue in ancient Greece.

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,920
The Colossus of Rhodes is an example.

130
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,280
So Colossal is used to describe physical and abstract things that are very large.

131
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,440
You could talk about a Colossal task or a Colossal debt, even.

132
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,080
That's topical, isn't it?

133
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,520
The next one, immense.

134
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:39,200
This one, immense, is more often used of abstract nouns, perhaps, but it doesn't mean you

135
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,920
can't use it for physical things as well.

136
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,280
You might say it gave me immense pleasure to work with him, or he felt immense pride

137
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,920
in his work.

138
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:59,200
The last example I gave of words for very large, the auditorium was vast and silent.

139
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,160
That's a quote from Jim Morrison and the doors.

140
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,720
A good 1960's bound, if you know them.

141
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:14,640
vast, V-A-S-T, another adjective meaning very large, but vast is more often used of empty space.

142
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:22,120
A warehouse might be vast, or there are vast distances in outer space.

143
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,240
You might also hear vast used for quantity as well.

144
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,560
Vast songs of money is a phrase or vast amounts of rubbish.

145
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,880
So a quick rundown again of those words, different words for large or big synonyms, giant,

146
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,560
gigantic, gargantuan.

147
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:53,280
Huge, humongous, enormous, colossal, immense and vast.

148
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,880
Listen to this podcast a number of times until you are comfortable that you know all

149
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,200
of these words, so that you recognise them when you hear them, but perhaps also so that

150
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,560
you can use them when you speak.

151
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,320
That is enriching your vocabulary, making your vocabulary more vivid in English.

152
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,360
Have fun with it, surprise people with these words that you've learned.

153
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,960
Enough for now, have a lovely day, speak to you again soon.

154
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Goodbye.

155
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,520
