Hi there, today let's do some more work on not using boring words, not using the basic

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,000
ordinary English words for things and instead on developing your vocabulary further.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,760
I did a podcast number 498 where I did the same exercise with words for good, so I gave

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,080
you a lot of different synonyms for good which will help your English language learning.

5
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:41,280
Hello, I'm Hillary and you're listening to Adapt English.

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,040
We will help you to speak English fluently or you have to do is listen, so start listening

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,640
now and find out how it works.

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,320
This podcast will help you sound more like a native English speaker and less like a beginner

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
at speaking English.

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,520
So let's develop your vocabulary, let's make it more vivid, not boring.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,320
And today I'm going to do words for big or large.
